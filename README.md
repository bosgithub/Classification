### Classification

What is classification?

Classification is a process to predict qualitative responses. This involves assigning the observation to a category. This is done by predicting the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable.

Some examples would be the color of our eyes{green,brown, blue} or fraudulent emails{spam, ham}

Common classification techniques(classifiers):

1. Logistic regression

2. Linear Discriminant analysis

3. K-nearest neighbors

there are some more computer-intensive(non-linear) models such as GAM, trees, random forests, and boosting, and support vector machines






Given a feature vector X and a qualitative response Y, taking values in the set C, the classification task is to build a function C(X) that takse as input feature X and predict its value for Y(C(X) âˆˆ C). Predict which class belong to which, we estimate probabilities that X belongs to each category in C.
