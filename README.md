### Classification

What is classification?

Classification is a process to predict qualitative responses. This involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. Often, the way we acomplish this is by  predicting the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable.

the response/target variables of classification problems are qualitative/categorical variables, such as the color of our eyes{green,brown, blue} or fraudulent emails{spam, ham}

Given a feature vector X and a qualitative response Y, taking values in the set C, the classification task is to build a function C(X) that takse as input feature X and predict its value for Y(C(X) âˆˆ C). Predict which class belong to which, we estimate probabilities that X belongs to each category in C.
