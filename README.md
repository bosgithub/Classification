### Classification

#### What is classification?

Classification is a process to predict qualitative responses. This involves assigning the observation to a specific category or class, it is done by comparing the probability of each of the categories of the specific observation and assigning the one with the highest probability.

Some examples would be the color of our eyes{green,brown, blue} or fraudulent emails{spam, ham}

#### Common classification techniques(classifiers):

1. Logistic regression

2. Linear Discriminant analysis

3. K-nearest neighbors

there are some more computer-intensive(non-linear) models such as GAM, trees, random forests, and boosting, and support vector machines

#### How does it work?

We start with some training observations(x1, y1), ... , ï¼ˆxn, yn) to build a classifier, and test this classifier on unseen test data.

Example:
Predicting whether a person will default on his credit card payment, on the basis of annual income and monthly credit card balance.
